# Kalpataru
It's my MCA 6th semester major project created in PHP.

Kalpataru is a complete project solution that maximizes the speed and effectiveness of user efforts. Kalpataru Portal instantly administrative side posts positions created and user booking various events from the web site. A full set of intuitive tools allows the user to search and booking respective orders.

Kalpataru caters a two-way service. Firstly, a user can register himself with this. If the person is already a registered user, it is affiliated to update own profile. If not, is needed to be a registered user first. The users are required to specify their Name, Email id, age, phone No., etc. and these serve as the Key Functional Parameters while matching the User criteria.

Secondly, the registered user can access various types of events by using this website after the approval from the Administrative section. The Key Functional Parameters are the main arguments while accessing by the administrative section, considered amongst the updated event. Although, there is a provision for the non-registered users, who do not access any service/event.
